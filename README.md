## **Fun and small tool to generate ascii memes**

### This program saves a random meme from Reddit (using a meme api https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api) and converts it into Ascii text which you can save as a txt on your computer. Great for trolling your friends in Google Docs

### Another feature is DocsMemer, which you can use by going to **Tools** -> **Preferences** -> **Substitutions**, and running the program and quickly switching to the window / tab of the google docs menu. Then just wait until its finished, and then use *meme\<num> to make an ascii meme. Not that the meme does not look very like hte original.
